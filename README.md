Ektoplazm Flashfree
===================

[Ektoplazm](http://ektoplazm.com) is a website where you can listen and download freely licensed psytrance, techno and downtempo music.
However, it uses a non-free flash object as the main audioplayer.

This userscript substitutes the Flashplayer with browser-native audio players.
It works in Firefox (Greasemonkey) and Chromium (Tampermonkey).
